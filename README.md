# vowel-duplicator

This bash script reads a file of names and duplicates each vowel in the word one at a time. If the provided name has the same vowel in a row, it will be skipped to avoid the same output repeated.

## Prerequisites

A Unix-based operating system (e.g. Linux, macOS)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone or download this repository
2.  Navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository
3.  Make sure that the names.txt file is in the same directory as the script
4.  Run the script using 'bash vowel-duplicator.sh'

## Input File

* 'names.txt': This is the file containing the list of names to reformat. Each name should be on its own line.

## Output

The script will output the modified names to the terminal.
